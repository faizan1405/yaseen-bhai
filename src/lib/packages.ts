/**
 * Single source of truth for the package keys used across the entire app — the
 * demo simulator bar, access-control checks, privacy redaction, the payment
 * flow and the API headers all key off these EXACT strings. They must stay in
 * sync with the Prisma `PackageType` enum and the keys of `PREMIUM_PACKAGES`.
 *
 * IMPORTANT: the customer-facing UI labels intentionally differ from the keys.
 * Always reference the key, never the label, in logic:
 *   monthly_membership      → "Monthly Membership"
 *   good_profile_package    → "Good Profile Package"
 *   second_marriage_package → "Silver Plan"      (NOT a separate "silver_plan" key)
 *   high_profile_package    → "Gold Package"     (NOT a separate "gold_package" key)
