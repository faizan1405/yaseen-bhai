## 6. Decision Log & Change History
* **2026-06-13**: Project initiated. Structure for `PROJECT_NOTES.md` established.
* **2026-06-13**: Approved tech stack finalized. Phase 1 completed.
* **2026-06-13**: Phase 2 completed. Configured Prisma ORM with Neon PostgreSQL schema, implemented Auth.js v5 route endpoints, developed a 5-step registration wizard with validations, built admin call verification queue with audit logs, and integrated a transparent server-side simulator fallback mechanism. Linting & production build validated.
* **2026-06-13**: Phase 2.5 completed. Conducted comprehensive static security audit and code path verification for database connectivity, OAuth flow, onboarding validation, verification queue, and privacy filters. Prepared full integration guides for production environments. Code linting and Next.js production builds verified clean.
* **2026-06-13**: Phase 3 completed. Added payment order creation and signature verification routes for Razorpay, implemented standard ₹300 monthly membership with dynamic 18% GST (₹54), added viewer subscription checks to redact profile details, integrated frontend checkout loader, and verified builds/lints cleanly.
* **2026-06-13**: Complete Frontend Redesign completed. Redesigned layout to use a premium marriage-card invitation aesthetic with soft cream backgrounds, Islamic geometric SVG patterns, and 8 controlled themes. Added sections for How It Works, Testimonials, Safety, Referrals, and Wedding Services. Refined profile preview cards, details modal, mobile navigation drawer, and onboarding registration steps. Validated code and verified builds compile and lint cleanly.
* **2026-06-13**: Database backend migrated from Neon/PostgreSQL to MongoDB Atlas. Updated schema to conform to MongoDB ObjectIds and mapped relations. Configured connection status health check for MongoDB. Integrated production/preview fallback store safeguards and sanitized database exceptions. Validated builds and linting.
* **2026-07-08**: Removed the demo/simulator system entirely. Deleted the `DemoSimulatorBar`, the "Continue as Demo User" / "Enter as Demo Admin" shortcuts, and the chatbot "Demo Mode" indicator. Renamed the global `SimulatorContext` to `AppContext` (provider `AppProvider`, hook `useApp`). Stripped all `x-simulator-*` request headers and `NEXT_PUBLIC_DEMO_MODE` gating from every API route — access now relies solely on real Auth.js sessions (admin requires an `ADMIN` role). Removed the Razorpay simulator/mock checkout fallback (checkout requires live keys). Bundled sample profiles are retained as a read-only showcase fallback (renamed `sampleProfiles`, "Demo:" name prefixes removed). Type-check, lint, and production build verified clean.
